This repository contains the supplementary material for "The Impact of Importance-aware Dataset Partitioning on Data-parallel Training of Deep Neural Networks" published in [DAIS 2023](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-35260-7_5). Our author's version of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/ssheikholeslami/importance-aware-data-parallel-training/blob/master/importance_aware_dpt_authors_version.pdf).

# Pre-requisites
### GPUs
As this system deals with data-parallel training of deep neural networks, you will need multiple CUDA-capable GPUs to run the code. The experiments in the paper were done using 4 Nvidia GPUs on a single machine running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
### Python Version
To run the code without any issues, we recommend that you create a Python virtual environment with **Python 3.8**, e.g., with `python3.8 -m venv env-name`, activate the environment using `source env-name/bin/activate` and then clone the repo and use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the specific versions of the required libraries. 

# Running the Experiments

- if you are interested in reproducing the box plots of Figure 5, you can use the `plots.ipynb` notebook. We have included CSV files of all our experiments in the `PaperCSVs` folder.

- if you want to re-run the exact same experiments in the paper yourself, please remember that you will need a worker with 4 Nvidia GPUs (please refer to Section 5.1 of the paper for our experimental setup) and it will take around 2 weeks in total to finish all the experiments. To run the experiments, simply execute the `run-experiments.sh` script, e.g., by `nohup ./run-experiments.sh &> logs.txt`.
- if you are interested in running only a specific set of experiments, you can comment out or modify the `run-experiments.sh` script.
- if you have a [Weights & Biases (W&B)](https://wandb.ai/) account, you can modify the code in `dpt.py` by searching for and uncommenting the lines that have `wandb` to manage the experiments using W&B.
